message about the destructor being invoked. Create objects using different
constructors and display them.

2.Create a class which stores time in hh:mm format. Include all the constructors.
The parameterized constructor should initialize the minute value to zero, if it is
not provided.

3.Create a class which stores a string and its length as data members. Include all the
constructors. Include a member function to join two strings and display the
concatenated string.

4.Write a program to demonstrate the order of call of constructors and destructors for a class.


5.Write a program to create a class that stores name and subject marks of two students. 
Using dynamic constructor allocate name and subject marks. Display the details along with average mark.
