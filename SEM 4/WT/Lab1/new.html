    <p>KIIT was established in 1992 as a vocational training centre with only two staff and 12 students. However, it took shape as an institution only in 1997, when degree engineering programme commenced. KIIT owes its existence to the vision of its founder
        Prof. Achyuta Samanta who, with no land, limited finances (only Rs. 5000/-) and little knowledge of higher education to create an institution for the benefit of the society. From these small beginnings, KIIT has developed into a leading university
        with a strong interdisciplinary culture and a commitment to teaching excellence.</p>

Daffodils
	-William Wordsworth

A host, of golden daffodils;
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze …
